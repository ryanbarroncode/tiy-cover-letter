	Hello, my name is Ryan Barron. World of Warcraft helped me become who I am today… I became interested in the game at a young age, with that being said I didn’t think a lot about how the game worked at first but as I grew I became more interested on how it worked. I worked in concrete construction for the first part of my professional career most notably in Alaska during the reconstruction of the Ben Boeke ice hockey center. It taught me about what it takes to truly have a good work ethic. You must have a passion for what you do and while I took my job very serious and gained all the knowledge I need to be a professional in the trade, I realized I didn’t have the passion for concrete construction. Which led me ultimatly to The Iron Yard in Greenville, SC,.
<br>
	I found the passion! Alas it was right in front of my the whole time! I played World of Warcraft all the time and thats why I created a responsive website for my guild using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, React, Bootstrap, Sass, to name a few. The Iron Yard taught me the skills and tools ill need to pursue what really brings me a personal level of joy that I express through my work. 
	I believe I have the very passion that was in the men who founded blizzard in 1991. This is just the very beginning for me and my education in software engineering and web development. Taking the next step of my adventure with blizzard would be best case scenario for me.

				Best Regards,    Ryan Barron
